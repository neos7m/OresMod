# Neos7m's Ores Mod
Welcome to Neos7m's Ores Mod!
This mod adds five new ores and eight new material types to Minecraft.
## Materials
This mod adds the following ores:

 - **Tin**: more resistant than wood, but less than stone
 - **Zinc**: a bit better than tin; still not as good as stone
 - **Copper**: better than stone, but not as good as iron
 
 You can combine these ores to get the following additional materials:
 - **Bronze**: combine copper and tin ingots; stronger than iron, but not as strong as diamond
 - **Brass**: combine copper and zinc ingots; a bit stronger than bronze

Both are obtained by shapeless crafting and will produce two ingots.
You can also smelt an iron ingot to get **steel**, which is more resistant than iron, bronze or brass; in fact, it's closer to diamond than to iron, although it's still not as good as it.

Finally, in the very deep... well, depths of the world, you can find these two gems:

- **Ruby**: stronger than diamond, not as strong as netherite
- **Sapphire**: stronger than ruby, and almost as strong as netherite

## Tools
With the gems and ingots from Neos7m's Ores Mod, you can craft the five basic tools:

- Pickaxes
- Shovels
- Axes
- Hoes
- Swords

Moreover, you can craft armor:

- Helmets
- Chestplates
- Leggings
- Boots

## Localization

If you want to translate the mod, make a copy of en_us.json in the 
src/main/resources/assets/oresmod/lang folder, translate whatever is
to the right of the colon (:) into your language, give it the right name
(es. zh_ch.json for Mandarin Chinese, or fr_fr for French) and make a
pull request. I will accept it after verifying that it's complete.
